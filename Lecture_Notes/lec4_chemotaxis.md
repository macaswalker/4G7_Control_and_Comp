# Chemotaxis

## Chemotaxis Basics

### Chemotaxis is a widespread cellular phenomenom

- Large unicellular organisms such as amoebas possess receptors on their membrane that allow them to sense chemical gradients across the cell diameter

- Cells in multicellular organisms, e.g. axonal growth cones in neurons, do the same during development, sensing hormonal cues to navigate tissue and find their targets

- In the above examples, differential activation of receptors drives (de) polymerisation of the cytoskeleton: the stiff scaffold inside the cell reassembles in the direction of chemoattractants and away from repellants, physically steering the cell

###Â Chemotaxis in Small, Motile Cells

- Many single-celled organisms, including E Coli, are **motile**
- Cells are propelled by **flagella**, and sense chemicals (nutrients) in the environment with **receptors**, even at low concentrations
- In an environment where there is a concentration gradient, the cells move in the net direction of the gradient.

### Mechanics of Bacterial Mobility

- Flagella attached to motor proteins that propel through aqeuous environments
- Propulsion is possible because of differential viscous drag on cell body vs flagellum microtubule
- Forward moving runs are punctuated by short tumbles the occur when the motor proteins switch and rotate clockwise

### Single Cell Chemotactic Behaviour

Runs have a **constant velocity** and each tumble **randomly** reorients the cell
